## 2025-12-14 - Pause Screen Clarity & Rendering Hygiene
**Learning:** The "Paused" state was represented merely by text, which can get lost against a busy game background. A semi-transparent overlay provides immediate, global feedback that the game state is frozen. Also, uncovered a double-rendering bug where the UI was drawn twice per frame, likely due to copy-paste errors or logic drift.
**Action:** When implementing modal states (like Pause), always use a full-screen scrim/overlay to reduce cognitive load. Also, audit the main render loop for redundant system calls to ensure performance and visual consistency.
