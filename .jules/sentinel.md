## 2026-01-06 - [TOCTOU Vulnerability in File Loading]
**Vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition existed in `CampaignManager.load_progress`. The code checked the file size with `os.path.getsize` before opening it. An attacker could swap the file for a massive one between the check and the read, causing memory exhaustion (DoS).
**Learning:** Checking a file's properties (like size) and then opening it in a separate step is inherently insecure against race conditions. The state of the file system can change at any moment.
**Prevention:** Always enforce constraints *during* the read operation. Use `f.read(limit)` instead of trusting a pre-check. This "atomic" approach ensures the constraint is respected regardless of external changes.
