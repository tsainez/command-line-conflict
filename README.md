# command-line-conflict

A fast-paced, open-source RTS game inspired by Starcraft, rendered entirely in charming ASCII art and designed for cross-platform play.

## Getting Started

This project uses **Python** and `pygame` for its simple and readable implementation. To run the prototype:

```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
```

The current prototype lets you left-click and drag to select units and right-click to command them to move on the grid.
